## Git repository for ALSPAC 'Longitudinal description of RSBB data' analysis code (B3911)

This repository contains one R .r file which processes the raw data, explores how RSBB changes over time at an
individual level (and creates sankey plots to present this information), and then conducts a simple illustrative
analysis on how this longitudinal RSBB data can be analysed.

Note that ALSPAC data access is through a system of managed open access. Information
about access to ALSPAC data is given on the ALSPAC website 
(http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/access/). These datasets used in these
scripts are linked to ALSPAC project number B3911; if you are interested in accessing
these datasets, please quote this number during your application.
